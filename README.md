# Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS

## Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

### Project Description:

In this project, you will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table through a RESTful API.

### Steps to Build the Project:

Create a DynamoDB table to store the items.
Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
Create an API Gateway RESTful API to interact with the Lambda function.
Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.

### Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS. They will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, and Cognito. Additionally, they will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
